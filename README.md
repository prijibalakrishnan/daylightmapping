# Daylight mapping for the outdoors

What are daylight levels under a tree shade? What are daylight levels under a sail shade, PTFE, ETFE shade? What is the difference in daylight levels between a closed and an open window? To answer these and many more such questions there are two ways to go about it - we can either measure them or painstakingly model such scenarios to predict daylight levels. 

A quick and easy way to start building an intuition for daylight levels of our surrounding environment is to measure lux levels and share them.

**To make it as painless as possible, I encourage you to use the hashtag `#daylightmapping` to tag your tweets of daylight measurements (examples are provided below).**

Once in a while, I will run a script to scrape the tweets and collect the data, to be made available in this public repository. Daylight measuring instruments are expensive and hence sharing the information helps.

###  How to use the #daylightmapping 

1. Take a picture that describes the context you are measuring and a picture of the reading on sensor.

2. Describe your observation in the tweet with the following attributes:
  - **Hashtag `#daylightmapping`**.
  - Time of the day.
  - Month
  - Sky condition (clear sky, cloudy sky, overcast, direct sun)
  - Location, either manually or allow your tweet to be geotagged (in this case, post the tweet from where you took the picture).
